# Riftbound Rules
Simplified rule set for Riftbound: League of Legends Trading Card Game

## Goal of the Game
_Riftbound_ is a Trading Card Game for 2-4 players where you join forces with your favorite _League of Legends_ champions. Play out your army and conquer the battlesfields of Runeterra to win.

Each battlefiled you take with your unites scores 1 point, and each turn you hold one earns you 1 more. **The first to 8 points wins!**

## Parts of a Deck
To play _Riftbound_, you'll need a deck. Preconstructed decks are a good place to start!

Your deck has a number of components:

**1 Champion Legend:** This special card determines what champion you're teaming up with and which Domains you can play in your deck. It starts with your Legend Zone.

**Battlefields:** These horizontally laid out cards represent locations on Runeterra that you and your opponents will fight over. This deck include 3 battlefield cards.

**12 Run Deck cards:** These are the runds you'll use to pay costs during the game. You need exactly 12 runes, in any combination of the Domains of your champion legend. This deck use an even split of 6 and 6, which is always a good place to start.

**40 Main Deck cards:** These are the unites and spells that you'll play during the game. One of these is your Chosen Champion, which goes to your Champion Zone alongside your legend. Shuffle the remaining 39 cards to become your starting Main Deck.

## Chosen Champion
Your **Chose Champion** is a champion unit that matches your Champion Legend. It starts in your Main Deck, but is put in the Champion Zone before the game. You can choose any Champion unit whose tag matches your Champion Legend. Your Main Deck can have a maximum of 3 copies of each card, including your Chosen Champion.

You can also include up to 3 copies of a signature card that matches your Champion Legend -- usually a signature spell. Signature cards can only be included with their matching legend.

Your Champion Legend, Chosen Champion, and signature cards often point to a particular strategy, like playing lots of units or discarding cards. Your other Main Deck cards and even your battlefields can help support that strategy.

## Key Game Terms

**Card:** This refers to a card in your Main Deck! It doesnt include legends, runes, battlefields, or tokens.

**Ready:** This card or rune is upright and ready to be used!

**Exhaust:** Cards, runes, and legends exhaust, or turn sideways, to move or use ⤵️ abilities. They can't exhaust again until readied.

**Recycle:** Put a card or rune on the bottom of the appropriate deck.

**Channel:** Take the top run(s) of your Rune Deck and put them on the board. You channel 2 runes at the start of each turn, and spells and abilities may tell you to channel at other times.

**Token:** Tokens are units that are created during play instead of starting in your deck. You can use printed tokens to represent them, but don't worry if you run out -- anything you can clearly ready and exhaust can be a token!
